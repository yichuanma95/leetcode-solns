# leetcodeSolns
My solutions to problems on LeetCode that have been accepted. That is, ones that I did
successfully myself, without looking at others' solutions.

I prefer not to write fancy solutions because I only want to master the fundamentals to
write solutions that work. It is important to master fundamentals before all else.
