/*
Problem 226: Invert Binary Tree

Invert a binary tree.

Example:
Input:
     4
   /   \
  2     7
 / \   / \
1   3 6   9
Output:
     4
   /   \
  7     2
 / \   / \
9   6 3   1

Trivia: This problem was inspired by this original tweet by Max Howell:
    Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you canâ€™t invert
    a binary tree on a whiteboard so f*** off.

Solution runtime: 0ms, faster than 100% of Java submissions
