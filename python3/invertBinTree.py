Problem 226: Invert Binary Tree

Invert a binary tree.

Example:
Input:
     4
   /   \
  2     7
 / \   / \
1   3 6   9
Output:
     4
   /   \
  7     2
 / \   / \
9   6 3   1

Trivia: This problem was inspired by this original tweet by Max Howell:
    Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you canâ€™t invert a binary
    tree on a whiteboard so f*** off.

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:        
    def invertTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        if root is None:
            return None
        root.right, root.left = self.invertTree(root.left), self.invertTree(root.right)
        return root
