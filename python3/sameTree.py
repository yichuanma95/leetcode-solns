Problem 100: Same Tree

Given two binary trees, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical and the nodes have
the same value.

Example 1:
Input:     1         1
          / \       / \
         2   3     2   3

        [1,2,3],   [1,2,3]
Output: true

Example 2:
Input:     1         1
          /           \
         2             2

        [1,2],     [1,null,2]
Output: false

Example 3:
Input:     1         1
          / \       / \
         2   1     1   2

        [1,2,1],   [1,1,2]
Output: false
